# Housing_Market_Analysis
Ever wondered what makes some neighborhoods feel like a million bucks while others are more budget-friendly? In this project, I dissect the King County housing market, revealing how size, location, and that coveted view can turn a house into a hot commodity.

This analysis set out to understand what drives housing prices and sales trends across different neighborhoods in King County. By examining factors like property size, location, grade, and view, we aimed to uncover patterns and gain insights into the local housing market.

### Key Findings
Our findings highlighted some clear trends: waterfront properties and homes with premium views consistently fetched higher prices. Expensive neighborhoods, particularly zip codes like 98039 and 98004, emerged as top-tier areas, commanding much of the high-end market. Features such as square footage, the number of bathrooms, and overall construction quality were also key influencers on pricing, showing just how important spacious, well-built homes are to buyers.

### Limitations
Despite these insights, a few limitations stand out. This analysis was based on data from 2014 to 2015, which doesnâ€™t account for any market changes or recent renovations that might affect prices today. Proximity to popular amenities and other external factors were also not considered, which could add more context to the pricing landscape.

### Recommendations
In future analyses, adding more recent data along with factors like economic indicators or nearby amenities would give a fuller picture of the King County market. Predictive modeling could also help estimate future prices, offering practical value for both real estate investment and property valuation.

Ultimately, this analysis emphasizes just how much location and property features shape housing prices in King County, laying a foundation for data-driven decisions in real estate.
